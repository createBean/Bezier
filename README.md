**Introduction to Bessel curve** 

Take a look at the official introduction to the magical Seibel curve: the Bessel curve, which was widely published by French engineer Pierre Bessel in 1962, uses the Bessel curve to design the main body of a car. The Bessel curve was originally developed by Paul de Casteljau in 1959 and developed by using the de Casteljau algorithm, and the Baez curve was obtained by stabilizing numerical methods. The Bessel curve is mainly used for two-dimensional graphics applications in mathematical curve, curve from the starting point and end point (also called anchor) and control points, by adjusting the control points, the Bessel curve will change the shape.  
  
  **The application of Bessel curve in Android**  

In fact, the Bessel curve in the Android custom View, or a lot of use, such as  

- Android 5 after the drop refresh shadow curve  

- Small red dots for QQ message reminders  

- A moving animation that displays the number of points used for left and right slides  

- Fluctuation of water flow  

- A drawer menu with an elastic effect     

**Android Path Method for providing Bessel curve in class**

In Android development, to achieve the Bessel curve is actually very simple, because Android has provided us with the relevant interface, this interface method in the Path class, and the class of Path to explain, in front of a blog is introduced. And through the Android of API, you know, the Bessel curve starts with API1. Here is the API method for the Seibel curve.
